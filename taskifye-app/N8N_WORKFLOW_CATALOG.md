## Workflow Development Guidelines

### Template Structure
```javascript
{
  "name": "workflow-name",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "webhook",
      "parameters": {
        "path": "workflow-name",
        "responseMode": "lastNode"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "function",
      "parameters": {
        "code": "// Data validation and transformation"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "if",
      "parameters": {
        "conditions": "// Business logic"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "http-request",
      "parameters": {
        "url": "// External API call"
      }
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "errorWorkflow": "error-handler",
    "timezone": "America/New_York",
    "saveExecutionProgress": true
  }
}
```

### Error Handling Pattern
Every workflow should include:
1. Try-catch blocks around external calls
2. Retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Error notification workflow trigger
4. Graceful degradation options
5. Manual intervention tasks when needed

### Performance Optimization
1. Use batch operations where possible
2. Implement caching for frequent lookups
3. Parallel execution for independent steps
4. Pagination for large data sets
5. Async processing for long operations

## Deployment Strategy

### Environments
- **Development**: Test new workflows
- **Staging**: Integration testing
- **Production**: Live workflows

### Version Control
```
workflows/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sync-contacts-v2.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ process-payment-v3.json

```

### Monitoring Dashboard
Track for each workflow:
- Execution count
- Success rate
- Average duration
- Error frequency
- Resource usage
