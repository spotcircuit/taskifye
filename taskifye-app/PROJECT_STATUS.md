## 🚀 Market Gaps We're Addressing

### Problems with Current Solutions
1. **ServiceTitan**: $200+/user/month, complex, overkill for small teams

4. **Common Issues**:
   - QuickBooks sync failures and payment reconciliation problems
   - No predictive analytics or AI assistance
   - Limited offline mobile functionality

3. **True Integration**: Unified data layer eliminates double entry
