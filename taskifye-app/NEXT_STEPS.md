## ðŸ”‘ Key Decisions Needed

1. **Mobile Framework**: React Native vs Flutter vs PWA
2. **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-4 vs Claude vs fine-tuned model
3. **Deployment**: AWS vs Google Cloud vs Azure
4. **Payment Processing**: Direct Stripe integration vs QuickBooks only
5. **White-label Architecture**: Separate instances vs multi-tenant

Remember: **Focus on delivering core value first**. Each phase should provide immediate, tangible benefits to customers even if subsequent phases are delayed.
