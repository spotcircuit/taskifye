# Taskifye - Next Development Steps

## üéØ Immediate Priorities (Week 1-2)

### 1. Authentication System
**Goal**: Implement secure multi-tenant authentication

```typescript
// Required Implementation
- [ ] Install and configure NextAuth.js
- [ ] Create auth pages (login, register, forgot password)
- [ ] Implement session management with client context
- [ ] Add role-based middleware
- [ ] Create user invitation flow
```

**Technical Details**:
- Use database sessions (not JWT) for better control
- Implement magic link authentication option
- Add 2FA support preparation
- Create session validation middleware

### 2. API Endpoints for Multi-Tenancy
**Goal**: Complete REST API for agency/client management

```typescript
// Required Endpoints
- [ ] POST   /api/agencies                 // Create agency
- [ ] GET    /api/agencies/:id            // Get agency details
- [ ] PUT    /api/agencies/:id            // Update agency
- [ ] GET    /api/agencies/:id/clients    // List agency clients

- [ ] POST   /api/clients                 // Create client
- [ ] GET    /api/clients/:id            // Get client with branding
- [ ] PUT    /api/clients/:id            // Update client
- [ ] DELETE /api/clients/:id            // Soft delete client

- [ ] POST   /api/clients/:id/branding   // Update branding
- [ ] POST   /api/clients/:id/logo       // Upload logo

```typescript
// Required Pages
- [ ] /agency/dashboard               // Agency overview

- [ ] /agency/clients/new            // Create client wizard
- [ ] /agency/clients/[id]           // Client details
- [ ] /agency/clients/[id]/settings  // Client settings
- [ ] /agency/billing                // Subscription management
```

### 4. Quotes & Invoices Data Persistence

- `DELETE /api/quotes/[id]` - Delete quote
- `POST /api/quotes/[id]/convert` - Convert quote to invoice
- `POST /api/quotes/[id]/email` - Email quote PDF
- `GET /api/invoices` - List all invoices for client
- `POST /api/invoices` - Create new invoice
- `GET /api/invoices/[id]` - Get specific invoice
- `PUT /api/invoices/[id]` - Update invoice
- `DELETE /api/invoices/[id]` - Delete invoice
- `POST /api/invoices/[id]/payment` - Record payment
- `POST /api/invoices/[id]/email` - Email invoice PDF

**UI Components Ready:**

- ‚úÖ CreateQuoteForm component
